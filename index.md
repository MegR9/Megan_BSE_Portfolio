# Phone controlled robotic arm with different grabbing sensitivites
This project will be to create a robotic arm that you can control with your phone. You can make it grab whatever you want and it will grab each thing tightly but not enough to break the object. These different objects can range from glass to metal, each with enough grip to hold it and to not break or shatter it.

# Second Milestone
My second Milestone is to get the complete robotic arm base completely operational. This includes bluetooth connectivity for you to input where you want the arm to move. This is still in progress though.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was to get a servo connected and moving with the input of an arduino. To start this off, I needed to download and get a test
