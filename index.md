# Phone controlled robotic arm with different grabbing sensitivites
This project will be to create a robotic arm that you can control with your phone. You can make it grab whatever you want and it will grab each thing tightly but not enough to break the object. These different objects can range from glass to metal, each with enough grip to hold it and to not break or shatter it.

# Final Milestone

My final Milestone will be to get the arm to grab objects with different sensitivities

# Second Milestone
My second Milestone is to get the complete robotic arm base completely operational. This includes bluetooth connectivity for you to input where you want the arm to move. This is still in progress though.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was to get a servo motor connected and moving with the input of an arduino. To start this off, I needed to download and test out the Arduino program. This was accomplished by setting up a simple circuit to an led so it blinks on and off. After confirming that the program worked well, I figured out how to hook up a servo motor to an arduino and then program the Arduino to get the servo motor to move.
